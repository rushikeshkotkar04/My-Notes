Mathematics:
	Statastics and it applications:
		
		Types:
			
			1.Descriptive:
				It consists of organizing and summersizing the data
				
				Techniques:
					1.Measure of central tendancy
						Mean
						Median
						Mode
					
					2.Measure of dispursion
						Varianance
						Standerd daviation
						
		
		
			2.Inferential/Conclusion:
				Suppose u collect some data we make some conclusion using some experiments
				gives us some other data and that data called population data
				Exprimnets:
					Z-Test
					T-Test
					
					
	
	

Data analysis with python:
	
	1.Numpy:
		A mathematical lib helps to perform computation also help with matrix and list and other maths operations on data.
		
		everything in numpy array(np.array(list of elements)) are element wise
		
	
	2.Pandas:
		
		
		1.df[clname]     --> give clm its dtype is series
		2.df.loc[index]  --> give rows 
		3.df.iloc[index] --> give clm
