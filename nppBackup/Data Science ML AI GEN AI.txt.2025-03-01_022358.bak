Mathematics:
	Statastics and it applications:
		
		Types:
			
			1.Descriptive:
				It consists of organizing and summersizing the data
				
				Techniques:
					1.Measure of central tendancy
						Mean
						Median
						Mode
					
					2.Measure of dispursion
						Varianance
						Standerd daviation
						
		
		
			2.Inferential/Conclusion:
				Suppose u collect some data we make some conclusion using some experiments
				gives us some other data and that data called population data
				Exprimnets:
					Z-Test
					T-Test
		
		Population(symbol: N) and sample(symbol :n):
			
			consider we have a village of 100 people and i want to know what is the average weight of peoples in the village
			
			for
				-Population : we have to visit all peoples place and take weight of people
				
				as it is hard to do so we can give sample like some people and get there and conclude on it
				
			
		Measure of central tendancy
			1.Mean (symbol:μ)
				-Average of all elements in data set
				
			
			2.Median:
				Sort the data and gets middle value if odd numbers of element there else if even no is present
				then take middle to after sorting and the averatge of those two element will be median
				
				-Helps to fight against outliers
				
				
			3.Mode:
				
				Most frequent no present
		
		
		
		Measure of dispursion:
			dataset={1,1,2,3}
			Varianance(σ²):
				-It tells you how far the data points are from the mean, on average, but in a squared sense.
				
				Formuulla:
					σ²=sum(((dataele-mean)^2)/total elements))
				
			
				
	
	

Data analysis with python:
	
	1.Numpy:
		A mathematical lib helps to perform computation also help with matrix and list and other maths operations on data.
		
		everything in numpy array(np.array(list of elements)) are element wise
		
	
	2.Pandas:
		
		
		1.df[clname]     --> give clm its dtype is series
		2.df.loc[index]  --> give rows 
		3.df.iloc[index] --> give clm 
	
	
	Feature engineering:
		
		1.Handling missing values:
			
			Mechanism why missing values happens:
			
				1.Missing completly at random (MCAR):
					Without reason it happens like might be some error at entry end
				
				2.Missing at Random (MAR):
					Depends on other data why this data is missing
					Because there no data present for other entity
					
					like if you dont have mobile then u wont have mobile number
				
				3.Missing data not at random(MNAR):
					missing is because of some other reason or dependant
