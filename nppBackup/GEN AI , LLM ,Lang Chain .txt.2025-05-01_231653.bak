GenAI:
	-Models used in Deep Learning
		1.Descriminative Models:
			-Tasks like classification,prediction,regression
			-Trained on labeled dataset
			
			
		2.Genrative AI:
			-Tasks line generating new data 
			-generate new data trainied on Huge dataset
			
			-Models use in GEN AI:
				1.LLM: Large language model
				2.LIM:Large Image model
		
	-LLM Models:
	
	
		
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):
	-If we have Data Source eg PDF:
		-If we wanna make PDA as Documented QnA Application
	
	Steps to create the Applications like this:
		1.Data injection:
			-To get data from various sources like
			1.PDF,2.URLs,3.JSON,4.Imgs,5.Videos
		
	
LangChain ecosystem:
	-A framework to use to build GEN AI Application with any LLM model
	-All model in langChain are open source
	-LangSmith:
		-It has LangSmith help to do MLOPs things eg Debugging,Playground,evaluation,Annotaion,Monitoring
	-LangServe:
		Create chain as RestAPI and helps to tasks like Deployment
				

LangChain:
	-Imp Component of LangChain:
		-
