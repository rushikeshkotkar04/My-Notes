SOLID

S->Single Responsibility Principle
O->Open/Closed Principle
L->Liskov Substitution Principle
I->Inteface Segment Principle
D->Dependancy Inversion Principle


Single Responsibility Principle
	-Class should have only one reason to change
	>For solving the problem ->
		-For this u can make a classes having single function so they will treat as a Single Responsibility 		 Principle
Open/Closed Principle
	-Class is open for extension (can be inherit) but closed for modification (cant be modified).
	>For solving the problem ->
		-Make a interface to do something and extends that interface for different classes.
