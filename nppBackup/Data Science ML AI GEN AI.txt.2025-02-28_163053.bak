Data science:
	
	Mathsematics:
		Type of data:
			1.Numerical
				Numbers like height of people,page load time,stock price etc.
				
				Types of Numerical:
					1.Discrete Data:
						Integer based : can be counted
					
					2.Continuous Data:
						Infinite type data 
						
			2.Categorical:
				Categories like : Yes/No,Political parties, State
				
			3.Ordinal:
				Mixture of numerical or categorical
		
		
		Mean:
			Mean: Sum of all numbers/ Total numbers
		
		Median:
			Sort all numbers and find middle if odd no of elements 
			if even then middle two devided by two
		
		Mode:
			Most frequent number in list of numbers
			
			
		Standard Daviation and Variation:
			1.Variation = average(squared differences from the mean)
			example:
				dataSet=[1,4,5,4,8]
				
				mean=sum(dataSet)/len(dataSet)
				mean=(1+4+5+4+8)/5 = 4.4
				differences of each number to mean =
					(1-4.4,4-4.4,5-4.4,4-4.4,8-4.4)=(-3.4,-0.4,0.6,-0.4,3.6)
				
				squared diff=(11.56,0,16,0,36,0,16,12,96)
				
				avg of squared diff=(11.56,0,16,0,36,0,16,12,96)/5=5.04
			
			2.Standard Daviation:
				Square root of variance
					sqrt(5.04)=(+/-)2.24
				
				use to find out outlier in dataset
		
		population vs sample:
		
		Probability Density Function:
			probability of given range of values
					
	Matplotlib:
		
		we can plot the file
		we can save the graph
		we can plot more than on graph on same page/at once
		can adjust axex values
