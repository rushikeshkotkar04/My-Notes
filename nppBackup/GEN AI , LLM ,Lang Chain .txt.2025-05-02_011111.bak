GenAI:
	-Models used in Deep Learning
		1.Descriminative Models:
			-Tasks like classification,prediction,regression
			-Trained on labeled dataset
			
			
		2.Genrative AI:
			-Tasks line generating new data 
			-generate new data trainied on Huge dataset
			
			-Models use in GEN AI:
				1.LLM: Large language model
				2.LIM:Large Image model
		
	-LLM Models:
	
	
		
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):
	-If we have Data Source eg PDF:
		-If we wanna make PDA as Documented QnA Application
	
	Modules to create the Applications like this:
		1.Module 1
			1.Data injection:
				-To get data from various sources like
				1.PDF,2.URLs,3.JSON,4.Imgs,5.Videos
			
			2.Split/Devide Data into smaller chunks
				-Split into:
					1.Text
					2.Documented
				-Some LLMs model has limitation on context size that why it is imp
				
				-Techniques to split data:
					1.
			
			3.Embde(Convert text to vectors)
			
			4.Store the Converted Vectors from text into store:
				-VectorStore DB
					1.FAISS DB
					2.CHROMADB
					3.ASTRADB
			
			
		2.Module 2 (Retrive)
			-Retrieval chain
				-A interface to query VectorStoreDB
			
		
		
LangChain ecosystem:
	-A framework to use to build GEN AI Application with any LLM model
	-All model in langChain are open source
	-LangSmith:
		-It has LangSmith help to do MLOPs things eg Debugging,Playground,evaluation,Annotaion,Monitoring
	-LangServe:
		Create chain as RestAPI and helps to tasks like Deployment
				

LangChain:
	-Imp Component of LangChain:
		-Data Injection
