WebRTC:WebReal time communication
	-Video AUdio type task mostly
	-It uses STUN and TURN algos to find the public IP of other and Fallback server if P2P fails
	-It uses chunking of the video internally so no need of chunker 
	-It uses combine dof DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)-SRTP (Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol)
	-Sometimes need manual chunk the data
	
WebSocket:
	-For chatting app ,live leaderboard type things,File sharing
	-need to use wss (TSL over HTTP type) for security
	-Hnaldes chunking automaticakllu for big msges
	
	
	
HTTP/HTTPs-> For sending data like text or images or video 
			best for uploading things

	Perfect! Let’s go systematically. At the SDE2 level, HLD (High-Level Design) is mostly about clarity, scalability, and trade-offs. I’ll break it into must-haves, good-to-have, and exceptional ways to stand out.

1️⃣ Must-Have Things in HLD (to “pass”)

These are non-negotiable, the interviewer expects them:

a) Components & Architecture

Identify major system components/modules.

Example: Device, API Gateway, Server, Database, Monitoring Service.

Show how components interact.

Clearly mark responsibilities of each component.

b) Data Flow

Describe how data moves through the system.

Include triggers, events, or periodic actions.

Example: Device → Server (heartbeat) → Status Table → Monitoring Service

c) High-Level Tech Choices

Mention protocols and tech stacks conceptually.

Example: HTTP REST, WebSocket, MQTT, Redis, PostgreSQL.

No need for headers, method signatures, or DB schemas.

d) Scalability Considerations

How system handles growth in users/devices.

Mention load balancers, horizontal scaling, caching, async processing if relevant.

e) Reliability & Fault Tolerance

High-level approach for failures:

Retry mechanisms

Timeout handling

Redundancy / replication

At least conceptually, not low-level code.

f) Security & Access Control

Authentication, authorization, encryption considerations.

Example: API key, TLS for device-server communication.

✅ If you include all of the above, you will “pass” basic HLD expectations.

2️⃣ Good-to-Have / Optional (impress the interviewer)

These show you think like a senior engineer:

Metrics & Monitoring: How will you monitor device health, server load, alerts?

Data Retention & Cleanup: What happens to old heartbeat data or logs?

Trade-offs: Example: “We use HTTP polling instead of WebSockets to simplify firewall traversal, at the cost of slightly higher server load.”

Timeouts & Heartbeat Intervals: High-level reasoning for values, not exact code.

Message Formats: Mention JSON vs binary if relevant.

3️⃣ Exceptional Things / How to Stand Out

If you want to wow interviewers at SDE2 level:

a) Show Scalability Thoughtfulness

Discuss millions of devices and how server can handle load.

Suggest caching, queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ), or sharding DBs for scale.

b) Async / Event-Driven Architecture

Instead of just polling, mention optional push or long-poll for efficiency.

Show awareness of real-time vs batch trade-offs.

c) Failure Handling & Reliability

Mention exactly how system behaves if devices miss heartbeats, server goes down, or network partitions happen.

Use patterns like circuit breaker, retry with exponential backoff, dead-letter queue.

d) Extensibility

Show that your design can support future features:

Device groups

Different types of messages

Multiple protocols

e) Diagrams

Include clean, simple diagrams (component diagram + sequence diagram).

Visuals often impress more than words.

4️⃣ Summary Table
Aspect	Must-Have	Optional / Good	Exceptional / Standout
Components	Yes	—	Modular/extensible architecture
Data flow	Yes	Monitoring metrics	Queue/event-driven approach
Protocols / Tech	High-level only	Mention JSON vs Binary	Trade-offs / scalability
Scalability	Basic mention	Caching, async tasks	Millions of devices / sharding
Reliability / Faults	Basic mention	Retry / timeout policies	Circuit breaker, redundancy patterns
Security	Basic mention	Encryption / API key	Threat modeling / defense-in-depth
Diagrams	Optional (recommended)	Yes, sequence diagrams	Clean + intuitive + covers edge cases

✅ Rule of Thumb for HLD:

“Explain the system clearly, show scalability, fault-tolerance, and trade-offs. Avoid low-level code, DB schemas, or exact HTTP headers.”

If you want, I can draft a sample SDE2-level HLD for your device online/offline system including diagram, heartbeat flow, and design choices that you could use in an interview.

Do you want me to do that?
